# Wisdom Tiles

![concept](https://i.imgur.com/qPv7ERr.png)


This website is used in the 2021/2022 ISGA of the HvA as a multimedia component. New foreign students coming to Amsterdam can create their own wisdom tiles: introducing them to some Dutch culture.

The design was completely done by a group of visual design students. My main contact was Roos de Vries. All assets were created by them.

### Concept
After a short introduction of what wisdom tiles are, new students are presented with a tool to build their own Wisdom tiles in the browser. They can choose from a wide array of colors and patterns for the look of the tile. For the text, they can either generate a random Dutch wisdom, a World wisdom or write their own wisdom quote.

When the tile is complete, they can download the tile as a picture and are encouraged to share their picture online, so others can try the tool.

### Features
* Real-time editing of the tile, changes are reflected immediately
* Easily upgradable - add more quotes, colors or patterns easily
* Share API implemented to seamlessly share the tiles with the world
* Download the created tile as a picture
